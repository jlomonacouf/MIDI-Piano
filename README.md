This program uses NAudio to send MIDI signals to a virutal MIDI port. It creates a two octave piano that responds to user touch.The virtual
MIDI port can be connected to any Digital Audio Workstation in order to simulate using a physical MIDI controller. For windows, users can
download the LoopBe1 MIDI port from the following link: https://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html.
